# INTRODUCCTION

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing
believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number
of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up
with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# SCENARIO

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing
believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number
of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members.

## Characters and Teams

**Cyclistic:** A bike-sharing program that includes 5,800 bicycles and
600 stations. Cyclistic stands out for also offering recumbent bikes,
hand tricycles, and cargo bikes that provide a more inclusive
bike-sharing experience for people with disabilities and cyclists who
cannot use a standard two-wheeled bicycle. Most cyclists choose
traditional bikes, while around 8% of cyclists use the assisted options.
Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for recreation, but about 30%
use the bikes for commuting to work each day.

**Lily Moreno:** The Director of Marketing and your manager. Moreno is
responsible for developing campaigns and initiatives to promote the
bike-sharing program. Campaigns may include email, social media, and
other channels.

**Cyclistic’s Marketing Data Analytics Team:** A team of data analysts
responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps
drive Cyclistic’s marketing strategy. You joined this team six months
ago, and you have been dedicated not only to understanding Cyclistic’s
mission and business goals but also to finding ways to help Cyclistic
achieve them from your position as a junior data analyst.

**Cyclistic Executive Team:** The highly detail-oriented executive team
will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

## About the Company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-sharing service. Since
then, the program has grown to include a fleet of 5,824 geo-referenced
bicycles, locked within a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago.
The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other
station in the system at any time.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy has focused on building
general brand recognition and attracting broad consumer segments. One of
the key approaches that made this possible was the flexibility of their
pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual
memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are
called casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are
called Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s financial analysts concluded that annual members are far
more profitable than casual riders. While the flexible pricing helps
Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the
number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than
creating a marketing campaign aimed at all new customers, Moreno
believes there is significant potential to convert casual riders into
members. She points out that casual riders are already familiar with
Cyclistic’s program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno set a clear goal: to design marketing strategies aimed at
converting casual riders into annual members. However, to do so, the
marketing analytics team needs a better understanding of how annual
members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would purchase a
membership, and how digital media might influence their marketing
tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing Cyclistic’s
historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Questions

Three questions will guide the future marketing program: + How do annual
members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic’s bikes? +
Why would casual riders purchase annual memberships from Cyclistic? +
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become
members?

Moreno assigned you the first question to answer: **How do annual
members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic’s bikes?**

You will create a report with the following deliverables:

-   A clear instruction of the business task
-   A description of all data sources used
-   Documentation of all data cleaning and manipulations
-   A summary of your analysis
-   Supporting visualizations and key findings
-   The three most important recommendations based on your analysis

This project will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask,
prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

# PREPARE

Historical ride data from Cyclistic will be used to analyze and identify
trends. The latest 12 months of Cyclistic ride data can be downloaded
here. (Note: The datasets have different datasets are appropriate and
will enable the answering of the company’s questions. The data has been
provided by Motivate International Inc. under this license.) These are
public data that can be utilized to explore how different types of
customers use Cyclistic bikes. However, it should be noted that, for
privacy reasons, the use of personally identifiable information of
cyclists is prohibited. This means that connections between pass
purchases and credit card numbers cannot be established to determine if
casual riders reside within the Cyclistic service area or if they have
purchased multiple single-ride passes. The data for the entire year of
2023 was selected to avoid biases associated with partial periods and to
ensure that factors such as holidays, seasons, and other seasonal
patterns that may influence bicycle usage are taken into account, also
meets the ROCCC criteria (Relevant, Original, Complete, Consistent, and
Correct), ensuring the quality and reliability of the data for
conducting an accurate analysis.

# PROCESS

R with will be used for data analysis, statistics, and visualization due
to their significant advantages. R is specifically designed for
statistical tasks, featuring an extensive ecosystem of packages that
enhance its capabilities, such as ggplot2 for visualization and dplyr
for data manipulation. The active R community provides abundant
resources and support. RStudio serves as an integrated development
environment (IDE) that facilitates project organization, includes tools
for syntax highlighting and debugging, and supports version control
systems like Git. Additionally, RStudio’s integration with R Markdown
allows for the creation of reproducible documents that combine text,
code, and results, making it ideal for reporting. Together, R and
RStudio create a powerful combination preferred by analysts and data
scientists.

The data for the year comes in 12 separate CSV files, one for each
month. Once downloaded, the compare\_df\_cols\_same() function from the
janitor package was used to verify that all 12 datasets were suitable
for merging.

We start with loading the packages we will use.

```R
    library(tidyverse)  
    library(lubridate)  
    library(ggplot2)
    library(dplyr)
    library(janitor)

    ## Warning: package 'janitor' was built under R version 4.4.3

    library(scales)

    ## Warning: package 'scales' was built under R version 4.4.3

    setwd("D:/Proyecto_R")
```


## Collect data

Load the datasets an rename

```R
    M01_2023 <- read_csv("202301-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M02_2023 <- read_csv("202302-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M03_2023 <- read_csv("202303-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M04_2023 <- read_csv("202304-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M05_2023 <- read_csv("202305-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M06_2023 <- read_csv("202306-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M07_2023 <- read_csv("202307-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M08_2023 <- read_csv("202308-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M09_2023 <- read_csv("202309-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M10_2023 <- read_csv("202310-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M11_2023 <- read_csv("202311-divvy-tripdata.csv")
    M12_2023 <- read_csv("202312-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

## WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE

Before combining the datasets, it was checked whether the data frames
were row-bindable. The function `compare_df_cols()` was used, which
returns TRUE if there are no mismatching rows.

```R
    compare_df_cols_same(M01_2023,M02_2023,M03_2023,M04_2023,M05_2023,M06_2023,M07_2023,M08_2023,M09_2023,M10_2023,M11_2023,M12_2023)

    ## [1] TRUE
```

All the data was combined into a single data frame, and incongruities
were searched for.

```R
    annual_data <-bind_rows(M01_2023,M02_2023,M03_2023,M04_2023,M05_2023,M06_2023,M07_2023,M08_2023,M09_2023,M10_2023,M11_2023,M12_2023)

    ##   ..   member_casual = col_character()
    ##   .. )
    ##  - attr(*, "problems")=<externalptr>
```

Columns were renamed to make them understandable.

```R
    annual_data <- rename(annual_data, user_type = member_casual)
```
## CLEAN

The duration of each ride in minutes will be calculated and stored in
the `ride_length` column. The `difftime` function computes the
difference between the `ended_at and` `started_at` timestamps.
Initially, the result is of class `difftime`, which is not suitable for
direct numerical operations.

```R
    annual_data$ride_length <- difftime(annual_data$ended_at, annual_data$started_at, units = "mins")
```

It was verified that the user\_type column only had two possible values,
and it was checked for duplicates and empty IDs.

```R
    unique(annual_data$user_type)

    ## [1] "member" "casual"

    sum(duplicated(annual_data$ride_id))

    ## [1] 0

    sum(is.na(annual_data$ride_id))

    ## [1] 0

    sum(is.na(annual_data$ride_length))

    ## [1] 0
```

Columns will be added to list the date, month, day, and year of each
ride. This will facilitate the aggregation of ride data by month, day,
or year.

```R
    annual_data$date <- as.Date(annual_data$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
    annual_data$month <- format(as.Date(annual_data$date), "%m")
    annual_data$day <- format(as.Date(annual_data$date), "%d")
    annual_data$year <- format(as.Date(annual_data$date), "%Y")
    annual_data$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(annual_data$date), "%A")

```

The language will be changed to English, and a column will be added for
ride length.

```R
    annual_data <-  annual_data %>% 
      mutate(day_of_week = recode(day_of_week
                                  ,"lunes" = "Monday"
                                  ,"martes" = "Tuesday"
                                  ,"miércoles" = "Wednesday" 
                                  ,"jueves" = "Thursday"
                                  ,"viernes" = "Friday"
                                  ,"sábado" = "Saturday"
                                  ,"domingo" = "Sunday"))
```

Use `glimpse` to inspect the data and verify the type of the
`ride_length` column. It is important to note that the `ride_length`
column is initially of class `difftime`.

Convert the `ride_length` column from `difftime` to a numeric type to
enable further numerical operations. This conversion is necessary
because `difftime` objects cannot be directly utilized in mathematical
calculations.

```R
    annual_data$ride_length <- as.numeric(annual_data$ride_length)

    #remove rows from the data frame that have NA values in at least one column
    annual_data_v2 <- annual_data[complete.cases(annual_data),]
    sum(is.na(annual_data_v2))

# ANALYSIS

**How do annual members and casual riders differ in their use of
Cyclistic’s bikes?** Based on the quartiles, most ride duration fall
below 50 minutes. By setting this limit, the focus remains on the most
relevant portion of the dataset, avoiding the distortion caused by
extreme outliers. This helps to clearly visualize the central
distribution of the data without being skewed by a few extreme values.

```R
    sum(is.na(annual_data_v2$ride_length))

    ## [1] 0

    Q1 <- quantile(annual_data_v2$ride_length, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
    Q3 <- quantile(annual_data_v2$ride_length, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
    #Q1.2 <- quantile(annual_data_v2$ride_length, 0.25)
    #Q3.2 <- quantile(annual_data_v2$ride_length, 0.75)

    IQR_value <- Q3 - Q1

    ### Definir límites (1.5 veces el IQR)
    lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value
    upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_value

    ### Filtrar los valores dentro de estos límites
    annual_data_v2 <- annual_data_v2 %>%
     filter(ride_length >= lower_bound & ride_length <= upper_bound)

    # Crear el gráfico de violín con los datos filtrados
    annual_data_v2 %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = user_type, y = ride_length, fill = user_type)) +
      geom_violin(width = .4) +

Descriptive analysis of the `ride_length` variable will provide insights
and the distribution of ride duration across different user types.

```R

    ##   1.017   5.567   9.267  11.373  15.267  35.583

    annual_data_v2 %>%
      filter(user_type == "member") %>%  # Filtrar solo los usuarios tipo "casual"
      pull(ride_length) %>%  # Extraer la columna ride_length
      summary()

Convert to ordered factor the column and save the file for further
analysis.

```R
    annual_data_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(annual_data_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday","Sunday"))
    annual_data_v2$month <- ordered(annual_data_v2$month, levels=c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"))

    write_csv(annual_data_v2, "D:/Proyecto_R/annual_data_v2.csv")
```

It can be observed that the duration of rides is longer for casual users
during weekends.

Analyze users data by user type, weekday, weekends and holidays The
number of rides on federal holidays is calculated using the
`cal_us_federal()` function, which serves as an example calendar
representing the federal holidays in the United States. This calendar is
not historically accurate but reflects the currently recognized federal
holidays.”

```R
    holidays_2023 <- cal_events(cal_us_federal(), year = 2023)
    annual_data_v2 %>% 
      group_by(user_type) %>%
      inner_join(holidays_2023, by="date") %>%

This creates a seasons data frame with columns representing the start
and end months for each season, the name of each season, and a custom
color for each. These values will be used later to mark the different
seasons on the plot.

```R
    #data frame for later use in the plot
    seasons <- data.frame(
      start = c(1, 4, 7, 10),  # Srart month for each season
      end = c(3, 6, 9, 12),    # End month for each season
      season = c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn"),
      color = c("#0071bc", "#2e8540", "#981b1e", "#aeb0b5")  #color for each season
    )
```

These two blocks of code find the months with the maximum and minimum
number of rides for each user\_type. The max\_points and min\_points
data frames store these extreme values, which will later be used to add
text annotations to the plot.

```R
    # Find the maximum points
    max_points <- annual_data_v2 %>%
      group_by(user_type, month) %>%
      summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>% 
      filter(number_of_rides == max(number_of_rides))
    # Find the minimum points
    min_points <- annual_data_v2 %>%
      group_by(user_type, month) %>%
      summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
      filter(number_of_rides == min(number_of_rides))
```

This code creates a comprehensive plot, comparing the monthly number of
rides for casual and member users, with annotations for seasonal changes
and the maximum and minimum values.

```R
    annual_data_v2 %>% 
      mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE, week_start = 1, locale = "LC_TIME")) %>%
